Our study builds uponcurrent SR-based statistical downscaling by experimenting with a novelfrequency-separation (FS) approach from the computer vision field. To assessthe skill of SR models, we carefully select evaluation metrics, and focus onperformance measures based on spatial power spectra. Our analyses reveal howGAN configurations influence spatial structures in the generated fields,particularly biases in spatial variability spectra.

However, the FS experimentsdemonstrate the sensitivity of power spectra to a commonly used GAN-based SRobjective function, which helps interpret and understand its role indetermining spatial structures.

Current methods are inadequate in meeting this demand as they lackthe ability to preserve content or translate visual concepts effectively.Inspired by this, we propose a novel framework named visual concept translator(VCT) with the ability to preserve content in the source image and translatethe visual concepts guided by a single reference image. The proposed VCTcontains a content-concept inversion (CCI) process to extract contents andconcepts, and a content-concept fusion (CCF) process to gather the extractedinformation to obtain the target image. Given only one reference image, theproposed VCT can complete a wide range of general image-to-image translationtasks with excellent results.

In this paper, we describe a new proactive defense methodcalled FakeTracer to expose face-swap DeepFakes via implanting traces intraining. Compared to general face-synthesis DeepFake, the face-swap DeepFakeis more complex as it involves identity change, is subjected to theencoding-decoding process, and is trained unsupervised, increasing thedifficulty of implanting traces into the training phase. To effectively defendagainst face-swap DeepFake, we design two types of traces, sustainable trace(STrace) and erasable trace (ETrace), to be added to training faces. During thetraining, these manipulated faces affect the learning of the face-swap DeepFakemodel, enabling it to generate faces that only contain sustainable traces. Inlight of these two traces, our method can effectively expose DeepFakes byidentifying them.

Consequently, thesefactors contribute to reduced accuracy in digit recognition. To overcome thischallenge, we propose a two-stage deep learning approach. In the first stage,we create a simple neural network to identify distorted digits within thetraining set. This model serves to detect and filter out such distorted andambiguous images. In the second stage, we exclude these identified images fromthe training dataset and proceed to retrain the model using the filtereddataset. This process aims to improve the classification accuracy andconfidence levels while mitigating issues of underfitting and overfitting. Ourexperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,achieving an accuracy rate of over 99.5% on the testing dataset.
